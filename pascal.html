						<h1>The Pascal Game Engine</h1>
						<p><!-- spacing hack --></p>
						<p class="description">
							I created this game engine during the game engine track at DePaul (GAM 475, GAM 575, GAM 576).
							It was built using C++ and OpenGL.
							The engine utilizes many static libraries that I also made for class.
							They cover the following the following areas: 3D Math, File IO, and PCS Tree.
						</p>
						<p class="description">
							Here is a video overview of the Pascal Engine.
							More in-depth information can be found further down this page.
						</p>
						<h3>[ Video goes here ]</h3>

						<h3>What can it do?</h3>
						<p class="description">
							The Pascal Engine is pretty simple and is mostly for rendering models and animation for now.
							The core technology that powers it is OpenGL.
							It can open Models and Animations that have been converted to the .yogi format (<a href="yogi.html">see Yogi Archiver</a>).
							It can also skin Animations that have been loaded.
							Models and Animations are manipulated using different types of Game Objects.
							Models are attached to Simple Game Objects.
							Animations are attached to Rigid Game Objects.
							Both of these can be attached to other Rigid Game Objects and moved together as groups.
						</p>

						<h3>File Static Library</h3>
						<p class="description">
							The File Library is a wrapper for Win32 system file IO operations.
							It can:
						</p>
						<li>Open and close files</li>
						<li>Open files for read only, write only, or read and write operations</li>
						<li>Seek and Tell locations on disk</li>
						<li>Flush the file buffer</li>
						<li>Check if file handles are valid</li>

						<h3>Math Static Library</h3>
						<!-- TO DO : <img src="images/vect_scale.png"> -->
						<p class="description">
							The Math Library can many 3D geometric operations.
							It also wraps some basic trigonmetry from the C++ standard library.
							The library limits the use of types to increase performance, so floats are always used instead of doubles.
							The library contains operations and definitions for:
						</p>
						<li>Trigonmetry (general operations)</li>
						<li>Vectors (general operations, special constructions, conversions, and linear interpolation)</li>
						<li>Quaternions (general operations, special constructions, conversions, and spherical linear interpolation)</li>
						<li>Matrices (general operations, special constructions, and conversions</li>
						<li>Utilities for comparing floating point values within error</li>
						<li>Frequently used mathematical constants</li>

						<p><!-- spacing hack --></p>
						<h3>PCS Tree Static Library</h3>
						<p class="description">
							The PCS Tree Library can create and manipulate trees constructed using a Parent, Child, Sibling relationship structure.
							It can:
						</p>
						<li>Create and destroy PCS Trees</li>
						<li>Create, destroy, insert, and remove PCS Nodes</li>
						<li>Return information about a tree and its nodes</li>
